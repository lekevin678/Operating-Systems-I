This assignment encrypts and decrypts information using a One Time Pad (OTP) like system.

Keygen creates a key of a specified length.

There are two programs running in the background acting as daemons, otp_enc_d for encryption and otp_dec_d for decryption.

otp_enc will connect and send otp_enc_d the message and key needed to encrypt. otp_enc_d will collect all of this information and encrypts the message with the key. It will then send otp_enc back the encrypted message and otp_enc will print it.

otp_dec will connect and send otp_dec_d the ciphertext and key needed to decrypt. otp_dec_d will collect all of this information and decrypt the ciphertex with the key. It will then send otp_dec back the plaintext message and otp_dec will print it.



To compile:
    ./compileall

To Run:

First setup the daemons:
    otp_enc_d 57171 & (57171 is just an example; yours should be able to use any port)
    otp_dec_d 57172 & (57172 is just an example; yours should be able to use any port)

Create a key and write it into a file:
    keygen 1028 > mykey (mykey is just an example for a file name)

Encrypt:
    otp_enc plaintext1 mykey 57171 > ciphertext1

Decrypt:
    otp_dec ciphertext1 mykey 57172 > plaintext1_a
